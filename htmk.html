                                    <p>This answer can vary based on how you originally obtained your chosen swapping pair, various websites charge fees beginning at the initial purchase from your dollar amount. This amount can vary in either an upward or downward trend depending on the market. Users take their own risk when transferring value within the cryptosphere and The Pho Coin recommend highly to physically write down all purchases and transfer to most accurately track their initial investment.</p>

                                                <p>Gas is integrated into every transfer made on a given blockchain, some chains may offer different gas fees, but speaking generally, gas is similar to a wire fee. It can be taken away from the total amount or added on prior to the total. Gas is immutable and coded into the blockchain to insure long term health of the crypto. Every gas fee is reinvested into the token pool. </p>

                                                            <p>NO, PC simply uses Smart Chain technology which is available worldwide and in no part supports the Binance exchange. Users ultimately make the choice to choose their exchange however at this time The Pho Coin do not support Delta Crypt Ltd. (also known as Binance Assets), Fxsmart Robots, or Digitaly Invest as mode of exchange.
