                At this time we suggest you interact directly with the Binance Smart Chain (BNB Blockchain) by setting up a new network within Metamask. The steps can best be found here from “The Binance Academy Website” (https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/connecting-metamask-to-binance-smart-chain) 
                
                Once The Smart Chain Network has been adding to The Meta Mask wallet (all steps are the same using Desktop or a Mobile Device IOS/Android) simply select “Add Token” from the homescreen of The Meta Mask Wallet then copy and paste the contract address from the https://www.phocoins.com/ homepage, where it is clear displayed. </h5>
